# Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my French


# Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the command or Ctrl + e keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.


# Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
