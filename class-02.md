# Code in a Content Management System
- management system, blogging platform, or e-commerce application, you will probably log into a special administration section of the website to controlit.
The tools provided in the administration sections of these sites usually allow you to edit parts of the page rather than the entire page, which meansyou will rarely see
the <html>,<head>, or <body> elementsde in a Content Management System.
  
- The advantage of this approach is that people who do not know how to write web pages can add information to a website and it is also possible to change
the presentation of something in the template, and it will automatically update every page that uses that template. If you imagine an e-commerce store with 1,000 items for sale.
  
 - Some content management systems offer tools that also allow you to edit the template files. If you do try to edit template files you need to checkthe documentation
 for your CMSas they all differ from each other.You need to be careful when editing template files because if you delete the wrong piece of code or add something in the
wrong place the site may stop working entirely.
  
  
  
 **Looking at How Other sites are Built**
  
These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this
out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, at www.htmlandcssbook.com/ code/ and click on the link called "View Source."
Once you have opened this page, you can look for the View menu in your browser, and select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes
depending on what browser you are using.)
You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page.
You can see this result in the photograph on the right. The page you see is the window at the top; the code is below.
